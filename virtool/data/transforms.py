"""
Transforms are used to attach additional data to a dictionary before it is sent to the
client.

For example, you have a ``dict`` like the following:

.. code-block:: python

   label = {
       "id": 12,
       "name": "Apples",
       "color": "FF0000",
       "samples": ["abc123", "def456", "ghi789"],
       "user": {
           "id": "bob",
       }
   }

You have more information about the user and samples in separate collections and want to
attach it to the document before sending it to the client.

You can do this by writing two transforms that attach the user data to a dictionary with
a ``user`` ID at ``user.id`` and a list of sample IDs at `samples`.

You use :func:`apply_transforms` to apply the transforms to the label dictionary.

.. code-block:: python

   transformed = await apply_transforms(
       label,
       [AttachSamplesTransform(mongo), AttachUserTransform(mongo)]
   )

It is not efficient to serially perform each transform, so :func:`apply_transforms`
knows to prepare the data to be attached concurrently and then attach it when everything
is resolved.

Transforms are classes that inherit from :class:`AbstractTransform`. Minimally, you must
override the :meth:`prepare_one` and :meth:`attach_one` methods. If :meth:`prepare_many`
is not overridden, :meth:`prepare_one` will be called concurrently for each document in
the list.

Overriding :meth:`prepare_many` and :meth:`attach_many` allows you to optimize the
preparation and attachment of data to many documents. For example, if you wanted to
attach user data to a large list of documents, and you expect many of the documents to
have the same user ID, you could override :meth:`prepare_many` to only query the user
collection once for each unique user ID.
