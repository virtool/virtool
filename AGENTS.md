- Use `virtool migration create` to write new Virtool migrations.
- We use Syrupy-based snapshot testing.

- Use Mise to run tests and test infrastructure: `mise run test`. Pass through args to pytest li\*e: `mise run test -- tests/account -n4`.

- Don't include comments when it is clear what the code is doing.
- Always put imports at the top of a module.
- Our Linear team is called "Virtool".
